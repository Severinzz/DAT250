# Assignment 2


* **technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved**  
There were no problems with installing and using JPA. 

* **Inpecting the database**  
To inspect the database I used the built-in database tool in IntelliJ. At first there were some versioning problem of some sort with Derby, the project and the database tool, but that was resolved fairly quickly by downgrading from Derby 15.2.0 to 14.2.0.
